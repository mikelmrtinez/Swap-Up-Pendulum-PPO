#Swap-Up pendulum Continuous CartPole problem Proximal Policy Optimzier
In this repository you can find the project of the CartPole proposed to the students as the Reinforcement Learning final project "Swap-Up pendulum Continuous CartPole problem".
By running the file main.py you train the model and set the hyperparameters. The visualize_mode.py file renders the model that we have train previously as a proof that the problem is solved.
